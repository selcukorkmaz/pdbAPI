Description: This package designed to streamline the interaction with the RCSB Protein Data Bank ('PDB') <https://www.rcsb.org/>. It provides an intuitive 
            and powerful interface for searching and retrieving a wide array of data types from the 'PDB', including advanced functionalities like BLAST and 
            sequence motif queries. Built upon the existing XML-based API of the PDB, this package facilitates the creation of custom requests directly from R, 
            enhancing the ease of use and flexibility for researchers.
